## About Bat Reviewer

Bat Reviewer is a tool for browsing, listening to, and organising field recordings of bat echolocation calls. It enables rapid visualisation of waveforms and spectrograms, basic signal inspection, file copying, and heterodyne audio preview for quick in-field analyses.

##  Installation

Bat Reviewer requires MATLAB Runtime 2023b, a free tool available that requires no license or installation of MATLAB on the user's computer. 

The installation packages provide a web installer that downloads and installs the MATLAB Runtime (MCR) along with the Bat Reviewer package. Ensure a reliable internet connection for the MCR download.

The standalone software is available for macOS (Apple Silicon) and Windows X64. Download the release suitable for your OS and install it like any package. 

The first time it is run, it may require additional setup in the backend; therefore, it may seem sluggish. Subsequent launches run normally.
